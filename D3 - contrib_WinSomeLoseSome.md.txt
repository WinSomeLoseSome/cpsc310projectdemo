- tests

I worked on the parser, and was in the process of working to understand
the JSON and iterating through it when my partner (Carey) loaded a ~85%
done D3. I then created a function for lat lon and was working on wiring
the Promises for it when Carey uploaded a 100% D3. I have local history
of my work but few commits because before I could upload a non-breaking
commit Carey uploaded his answers. I talked to Reid and he said the best
thing I could do is write tests, which I did. I also got a small head 
start on D4.
